**Syntax**: `(url) [-e "extension type"] [-d "destination"]` <br>
\- *double quotes are only for this example*

use `[-u "url"]` for a different syntax approach <br>
**Example**: `-e mkv -d C:\Users\*\Music -u https://*.com/*`

Obviously you can insert video ID instead of url, take your preference

### Known issues 
\- Video download will abort thus the file will remain corrupt while it's still streamable up to a point in the seekbar <br>
\- Audio works but sometimes will fail to download entirely (Fix: delete empty file & retry)
